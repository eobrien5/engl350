 ## Grant Reflection
 
Our Grant project is a site that compiles social media data about Esports and displays it visually. We look at 4 different social media platforms and compare the popularity of the Esports community and a number of individual programs/teams. With this API data, we then examine cross platform metrics to gain an understanding as to where this community resides and how we can spread it to reach a larger audience. 
 
This project has gone through multiple iterations and changes through our work on it. Initially, we wanted to look at professional sports leagues such as the MLB and NFL. This was going to be harder though because they are already larger and more established. Also, they are not exactly digital. When we had the idea to transition to Esports, we knew it was the right move. Esports, by nature, is much more ingrained in the digital world and still has lots of potential for growth.

Once we made this change, we both became even more excited about this project. Starting off with professional sports, we were both interested because we are athletes here at CNU. In talking to each other and Dr. Stover, we realized Esports is much more applicable and this only added to our interest. 

In the search to find similar projects, there is nothing we can find that compiles all this data the way we plan to. Many projects look at just the social media engagement or just an individual Esports player’s success. Interestingly enough, both of these categories are usually measured in dollars. Our project wants to shift the focus from revenue, to a growing and engaged community of people that enjoy playing with each other. 
	
One of the biggest takeaways I have from this grant process is how a project can evolve and change over time. We thought we had a good idea at first, and simply through discussion and brainstorming, we landed on something far more interesting. The environmental scan was initially all about how professional sports teams and leagues are compared based on how much money they produce. This didn’t seem to fit into digital humanities as much. Once we got into our grant narrative, it became clearer how shifting to Esports made more sense for this project. It was significantly easier to write the various pieces of the grant once we made this transition. 
	
With this project coming to a close, it is fascinating to think about where I am not with respect to DH in contrast to where I started. Through the first few weeks of class, I was admittedly pretty confused about what qualified as a DH project, and how it was unique from any other bunch of code. Through each class and each review, the idea became a little clearer. I still do not have a definition but I am at the point where “I know it when I see it.” 
	
The readings were probable the most helpful aspect of the class in order to get to the (limited) understanding I have today. Although it has only been one semester, I feel if there was a “most improved” award, I would be in the running. When looking at the DH projects in class, and then going home and reading different angles of the same topic, this process helped me round out a fuller picture of that it means to be a digital humanist. 
	
One of my favorite projects we examined this year was “What is Digital Humanities” by Jason Heppler. I spent way too much time refreshing the page trying to understand how so many people can define the same phrase so many different ways. I also really enjoyed reading “A DH That Matters” by Matthew Gold. The topics covered were so interesting and the addition of the annotations took it above and beyond.

To that point, it was at times more helpful to me to think about what it means to be a person involved in DH rather than how to meet a set of criteria to create a project. Digital humanists have a way of writing and communicating their topics such that it is easy to understand and feels more personable. A foreign yet refreshing experience from the stiff academic writing students are used to.
