**The Civil War Washington** (CWW) project encapsulates the war and the impact it made on the city of D.C. 
  The site contains detailed files of data, maps, texts and letters, pictures, as well as interpretations 
  of what was going on around the time. There is an authentic and historical tint to the site, offering 
  lots of primary sources and first-hand accounts. The particular uniqueness of the site comes from the 
  many perspectives that it examines the city from. This includes social, political, cultural, and 
  scientific/medical transitions the city went through. 
	As a digital humanities project, this website encompasses many of the aspects that elevate a project 
  beyond a simple essay. One of the primary interactive components is the interactive map of the city. 
  There are labeled, clickable icons that provide information about that building and how it played a 
  part in the Civil War. Under the Interpretations section, there is a plethora of essays that touch on 
  various topics mentioned in the Data section. The site is interconnected through the different tabs 
  and takes on multiple viewpoints that give a broader idea of what was going on in the city. 
	The technology used in the project could be expanded, but is a start for utilizing available tools. 
  Some of the pages are interactive with links disguised as icons and images, while others allow for a 
  virtual tour of Washington D.C. Another consistent theme in many digital humanities projects is the 
  brief statement of things and in general, shorter readings. CWW is “wordy” at times, with large blocks 
  of texts that scroll all the way down the page. While very informative, some classic DH readers might 
  be turned away by this.
	One of my favorite sections was under the Newspapers tab. There, they had a library of every newspaper 
  published in D.C. during the war. They are extensive, going on to say “Washington, Georgetown, and 
  Alexandria, nearly 30 daily and weekly newspapers chronicled the war.” It was really interesting to 
  read some of them from the perspective of the average reader back when they were in circulation. 
  These papers served as a large portion of what the American people knew about eh war and what was 
  happening all over the country. Having such a huge collection of these timeless papers is truly valuable.

The Civil War Washington site is a rich destination for history about an important chapter for our 
  nation. It explores dynamics that are often left unconsidered and uses digital humanities to bring 
  them to life a bit more. _Overall, I enjoyed exploring the site and was able to learn a great deal 
  from it._
