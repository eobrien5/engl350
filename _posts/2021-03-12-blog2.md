### Archival History of Computing at MIT, 1950-62

[_Archival History of Computing at MIT, 1950-62_](https://comphist.digitalhumanitiesmit.org/archives/), directed by Michael Scott Cuthbert, is a collection of the documents and stories surrounding the development of the MIT Computation Center during the mid 1900s. This digital humanities project contains archives of the people, organizations, and documents that all helped build the MIT computing program. In addition to the historical documents, there are also a number of stories, all of which provide interesting background and insight. The stories focus around the development of a supercomputer and the pros and cons associated, as well as the building of the IBM 704. Finally, the site contains a “Simulators” tab which is quite unique. There are 5 simulators, all of which process different inputs and build on one another. Although presented in ascending complexity, even the most basic is slightly overwhelming. 

When you first enter the site, the main components are the 6 pre-selected stories, the search bar and the navigation bar. Starting with the stories, while all interesting in their own right, there is no chronological order or flow between any of them. Some touch on similar topics, but none are directly connected. Additionally, there seems to be no reason why these were chosen to be on the home page over any of the other stories in the archives. The assembly and presentation aside, the content of the stories was exceptional and many included images that aided the information. I genuinely enjoyed navigating from story to story, reading about “Project Whirlwind” and how the 704-programming team was assembled. 

The search bar has suggested search items in order to help guide the user. These were nice because you could actually click on them and it would take you to the results of that keyword. This was really entertaining and useful because otherwise, there is no way for the user to know what to search for.

The simulators, found in the navigation bar, appear to be exposed machines that allow the user to see how a computer works. Part of the screen is dedicated to inputting variables and functions, and other parts produce binary code. There is a helpful mini-tutorial of pop ups when you first land on the page. These did a decent job of explaining how the page worked, but there is a degree of complexity that cannot be overcome by a few simple tips. I was able to operate the first two, but after that, I decided to move on to other parts of the project.

As a digital humanities project, this page fits the description in multiple ways. There are quality historical archives which fulfill the purpose of the humanities aspect. In the digital sense, there are multiple interactive aspects which draw in users. One of the stories, [“The Letter Network”](https://comphist.digitalhumanitiesmit.org/archives/net_viz), contains an interactive chart similar to those seen in other projects. The simulators add another dimension of interactivity to the project as well. Overall, the site is enjoyable to navigate around and there is endless quality content contained within. The stories add a lighter contrast to the heavy technical documents and simulators, so it is nice to be able to go back and forth. 

### Conclusion

Ultimately, this project is relatable to all users because everyone uses some form of technology now, so having background to how far machines have come is universally familiar. It covers all the bases of a DH project and it is apparent how much time and effort went into putting it together. I really had a quality time exploring this project, and was able to learn more about a topic that is interesting to me.
